# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math module
### Step 2: 
Assign the values for x1,x2,y1,y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
Print the distance between two points
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math
x1=4
y1=2
x2=10
y2=6
a=(x2-x1)*(x2-x1)
b=(y2-y1)*(y2-y1)
c=a+b
sq=math.sqrt(c)
print("{:.2f}".format(sq))
~~~

### OUTPUT:
